# Project- Linked List Implementation

This is an implementation of a Linked List, a useful data structure, using nodes and the inheritance concepts of Java.--
This implementation uses the NullObject Pattern in NullNode class.

The methods for the list are:

```java
void addFirst (Object o);// inserts an element at the start of the list

boolean includes (Object o);// checks if the list contains certain object

int size();// returns list size (0 if is empty)

boolean isEmpty();// returns true if the list is empty

int indexOf(Object o);// return the index where the object is in the list

void addLast(Object o);// inserts an element at the start of the list

Object extractFirst();// extracts first element in the list

Object extractLast();// extracts last element in the list
```

To run some unit tests, clone this Java project and import it as a project into your Java IDE (Intellij, Eclipse, etc.)

This program was written in Java so make sure you have a Java version installed on your machine.
